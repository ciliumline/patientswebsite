        <h4>“Hello. This Patient Insitute, be informed that we are health care web based patient assistant centre that makes sure
            that patients are equipped with all the necessary information that they should know about taking their medication and why they will
            benefit from following the prescriptions they are given by their medical practioners.
        </h4>
        <p>PTI(Patient Institute) is multinational medical center.
            Through our supplementary teachings that we offer to patients around Botswana and our work with mainstream private and public health institutions,
            we’ve helped over 1000 patients achieve their better health by giving them the necessary information they needed to know.</p>

        <h5>WAYS OF IPROVING MEDICAL ADHERENCE FOR
            PATIENTS</h5>
        <p> The problem of non-adherence to medical treatment remains a challenge for the
            medical professions and social scientists.
            <br>
            <h5>PATIENT EDUCATION</h5>
            A successful educational intervention may require participation from both the
            physician and patient. Admittedly, some patients may wish to entrust most of
            the decision making to their treating physician. It is, therefore, crucial to
            determine how involved the patient wishes to be in constructing the
            management plan (Harnett, Wiederkehr, Gerber, Gruben, & Koenig, 2016). As
            soon as this is established, a proper educational intervention could involve
            intertwining biomedical information into pre-existing lay belief systems.
            Patient education about the disease and its treatment by primary care
            physicians can help to improve adherence to medication (Joplin, Van Der
            Zwan, Joshua, & Wong, 2015)
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>ELCTRONIC REMINDERS</h5>
            An electronic reminder is an automatically sent reminder without personal contact
            between healthcare provider and patient. Patients who are adherent at first can
            become non-adherent over time. This may be the reason that (Pop-Eleches,
            Thirumurthy, & Habyarimana, 2011) found out that reminders can especially
            provide a solution for patients who are unintentionally non-adherent, i.e., patients
            who are willing to take their medication but forget it or are inaccurate with their
            timing. Forgetfulness is commonly reported as a barrier to adherence in various
            patient populations. (Haynes, Ackloo, & Sahota , 2008) Shows the range of
            patients reporting this barrier varies from 22% to 73% across the studies, in all
            studies forgetting to take a dose was the most frequently cited reason for nonadherence.
            Previous reviews evaluating strategies for improving adherence among which
            electronic reminders often focused on specific patient populations. For example,
            (van Dijk, Bouvy, Linn, Van Weert, & De Bakker, 2012) found that a reminder
            device might be beneficial to patients with glaucoma and that half of the studies
            included in their review reported significantly improved adherence in HIV patients
            as a result of Electronic Reminders.

            <h5>SIMLE MEDICATION LABELS</h5>
            In order for a patient to adhere fully to the instructions for a prescribed medicine, it
            is essential that, at the very least, the instructions are understood, can be acted on
            and can be recalled. One way of facilitating the communication of medicine
            information to patients with limited literacy is to incorporate visual aids such as
            pictograms on medicine labels and in patient information leaflets. Pictograms have
            been shown to enhance comprehension and recall of information when used both
            alone and in combination with text (Dowse & Martina, 2005). The interpretation of
            a wide range of pictograms has been assessed in participants from a number of
            different South African language groups all of whom displayed limited reading
            skills. These papers include comment on practical application as well as discussion
            on the misinterpretation of the pictograms.
