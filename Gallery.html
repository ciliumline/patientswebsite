                Drug absorption is the process by which a drug
                enters the bloodstream from its site of administration. 
                The rate and extent of drug absorption can be affected by a number of factors. 
                The method by which a drug is administered can greatly influence its absorption. Common routes include oral (by mouth), 
                intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), transdermal (through the skin), and inhalation.

                Medication absorption is the movement of a drug from its site of administration into the blood.
                 Oral drugs enter the stomach where they either dissolve and pass through the cell membranes of epithelial
                  cells lining the stomach or travel undissolved through the stomach to the small intestine, which is the most
                  common site of absorption.
